This dataset is is about ODSR <br>Source: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k

To use it, manual preprocess is still needed:

1) Check if following folder structure is provided in root folder: data/raw/images and data/raw/metadata
2) Download data and extract the images to outlierthub/data/raw/images and the data.xlsx file under odr/data/raw/metadata


preprocessing is here a challenge, because images are not equal in resolution

It is not a well curated dataset, its origin is also not from kaggle. Use it carefully.
